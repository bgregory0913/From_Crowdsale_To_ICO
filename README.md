# Project Overview:

* The intention of this project is to provide other blockchain developers a prototype Crowdsales SmartContract and demonstrate the use of open-source Solidity libraries such as OpenZeppelin to help understand how the process works from beginning to end. I'll demonstrate how build a simple, __capped__, __mintable__, and __refundable__ Crowdsale contract token using the OpenZeppelin library and Solidity.
* The first Solidity contract, [PupperCoin.sol](https://github.com/bgregory0913/From_Crowdsale_To_ICO/blob/main/PupperCoin.sol), is a standard `ERC20Mintable` and `ERC20Detailed` contract that will be used to create an ERC20 token that will be minted through the [PupperCoinCrowdSale.sol](https://github.com/bgregory0913/From_Crowdsale_To_ICO/blob/main/PupperCoinCrowdSale.sol) contract.
* The second Solidity contract, [PupperCoinCrowdSale.sol](https://github.com/bgregory0913/From_Crowdsale_To_ICO/blob/main/PupperCoinCrowdSale.sol), is the Crowdsale contract that will manage the entire process, allowing investors to send `ETH` in exchange for your coin. This contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.


## Getting Started:

### Part 1 - 

### Part 2 - 


## Resources
* This project is coded with [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) using the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and deployed on a local Web3 testnet on my own machine.
* You can use all of these resources as well on both Windows and Mac.
